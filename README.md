# Principle based Enterprise Architecture

Enterprise Architecture should not be Ad-hoc.  It should be based on principles and it should be measurable.

An architectural golden rule is like a "commandment". Adherence to the Golden Rules leads to higher long-term value for an technology assets. The golden rules are organized by *architecture principles*, which are in turn organized by **business objectives**.  These collectively define the non-functional requirements that every system ought to embrace, but which business requirements seldom specify.

## Business Objectives & Principles
The principles are categorized at different levels and grouped into high level business objectives as follows:

* **Safe** - Level 1 Governance 
  * Secure
  * Compliant
  
* **Reliable and Performant** - Level 2 Governance 
  * Reliable
  * Scalable
  * Manageable
  
* **Fast to Market** - Level 3 Governance 
  * Simple
  * Modular
  * Maintainable
  * Managed Data

* **Global** - Level 4 Governance 
  * Global

The Word Document, titled "Principle Based Enterprise Architecture" discussed the philisophy and approach to a measurable Enterprise Architecture and describes the meaning of the Principles and Golden Rules.

The excel file, titled "system asset scorecard" is the actual scorecard used to measure a technology system.  Instructions for filling out the scorecard are in a tab labelled "Instructions".  Additional guidance is provided in the associated document as well as this wiki.
